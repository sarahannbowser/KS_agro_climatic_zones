# KS_agro_climatic_zones
The state of Kansas spans a broad range of i) annual precipitation in the East-West direction, ii) mean annual temperature in the North-South direction, and iii) diverse topographies and soil types that create multiple macro-environments for agricultural production. However, existing ecological and climatic regions have been primarily defined on the siloed consideration of either atmospheric variables or geological features. There is need for a classification of the macro-environments for Kansas crop ecologies inclusive of the physical and climatic features that influence crop yields. The objective of this analysis was to re-define the agro-climatic zones of Kansas by adding key soil properties. Long-term (30 years) precipitation, vapor pressure deficit and temperature records at a scale of 4-km were obtained from the PRISM Climate Group, and soil information, textures and water holding capacity, was obtained from the NRCS-STATSGO2 product at the scale of 2.5-km. All datasets were downscaled to a common spatial resolution. Then, the k-means unsupervised clus-tering technique was used to classify the dataset into new, unique agro-climatic zones. The silhouette method was used to objectively evaluate the optimal number of agro-climatic zones by recur-sively evaluating the inter- and intra- class similarity.  These new agro-climatic zones could be used to better evaluate yield gaps and inform research and development strategies.
